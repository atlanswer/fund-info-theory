# Convergence Behavior of Iteratively Decoded Parallel Concatenated Codes

> Reference: S. ten Brink, "Convergence behavior of iteratively decoded parallel concatenated codes," in _IEEE Transactions on Communications_, vol. 49, no. 10, pp. 1727-1737, Oct. 2001, doi: 10.1109/26.957394.

## Introduction

Typically, bit-error rate (BER) charts of iterative decoding schemes can be divided into three regions:
1. the region of low $E_b/N_0$ with negligible iterative BER reduction
1. the turbo cliff region (also referred to as "waterfall"-region) with persistent iterative BER reduction over many iterations
1. the BER floor region for moderate to high $E_b/N_0$ in which a rather low BER can be achieve after a few number of iterations
